<h1>On me, myself...</h1>
<p align="justify">
<p>me:&nbsp;Hey! Whats up?</p>
<p>myself:&nbsp;ummm. I don&rsquo;t know. You tell me.</p>
<p>me:&nbsp;I asked you first.</p>
<p>myself:&nbsp;Why ask me? You should know that.</p>
<p>me:&nbsp;Why?</p>
<p>myself:&nbsp;Cuz you&rsquo;re me.</p>
<p>me:&nbsp;hmmm. Makes sense. Weird how I can refer myself.</p>
<p>myself:&nbsp;psss. It&rsquo;s because you, I mean I can think.</p>
<p>me:&nbsp;What &lsquo;think&rsquo;?</p>
<p>myself:&nbsp;&lsquo;consciousness&rsquo; bro. Like you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>me:&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>myself:&nbsp;hmmm. Why are we doing this again?</p>
<p>me:&nbsp;hmmm. I&rsquo;ve been thinking.</p>
<p>myself:&nbsp;Told ya.</p>
<p>me:&nbsp;Calling it &lsquo;thinking&rsquo; for sake of convenience. Whatever that is.</p>
<p>myself:&nbsp;-_-</p>
<p>me:&nbsp;Not thinking about how I think. But rather, now that I think, why I think what I think.</p>
<p>myself:&nbsp;Yeeaaah no. You&rsquo;re confusing me.</p>
<p>me:&nbsp;Exactly! I&rsquo;m confused.</p>
<p>myself:&nbsp;What do you suggest?</p>
<p>me:&nbsp;A coherent description of life i.e, &lsquo;my version of the story&rsquo;.</p>
<p>myself:&nbsp;What good will that do?</p>
<p>me:&nbsp;Well, first I admit I know nothing. This coherent description will definitely be based on and biased to my past experiences, basically what I&rsquo;ve learnt added to what my genes knew. Well, nature is the way she is, no matter how I perceive the world around me. Let&rsquo;s call it &lsquo;the original story&rsquo;. Now once I&rsquo;m aware of &lsquo;my version&rsquo;, throughout the remainder of my life, as more and more is found out about &lsquo;the original one&rsquo;, I should be able to put at least some of the pieces together. Hence, a little less confusion.</p>
<p>myself: A little less you say, after all this.</p>
<p>me: A little less. &lsquo;the original one&rsquo; will remain incomplete for ages I believe.</p>
<p>myself: ehh. It&rsquo;s going to take time.</p>
<p>me: I can&rsquo;t think of anything better to do.</p>
<p>myself: Well, now that you&rsquo;ve said that, neither can I. You should get out more.</p>
<p>me: (puppy face)</p>
<p>myself: Fine.</p>
<p>me: Yeessumm.</p>
</p>
