	<p align="justify">Hi! My name is <a href="/vaibhav">Vaibhav</a> and I was born and raised in a small hill-station named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nainital">Nainital</a>.
		This online space is representative of a personal diary where I can share my thoughts and have them reviewed, all the while observe them evolve overtime myself.
		If you've visited <a href="/diary">"theboxtroll.com"</a> before, then the changes you now see are due to the fact that I have now switched to GitHub Pages from BlueHost
		to avoid the hosting costs. I am yet to transfer all the posts and content, but hopefully it would be done soon.</p>
